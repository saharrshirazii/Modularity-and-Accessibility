# Improve User Flow (UX Analysis and Design)

## Purpose
Practice analyzing user flows and creating better UX through clarity, feedback, and structure.

## Task
1. Create a simple HTML page with a form that allows the user to register for a newsletter:
- Fields: name and email address
- A button: “Submit”

2. Implement simple feedback with JavaScript:
- When the user clicks Submit, a message should appear: “Thank you for registering!”
- Validate that the fields are not empty before the message appears.
3. Test the user flow with a classmate. Ask the person to explain what they think is happening in each step – observe if anything is unclear.
