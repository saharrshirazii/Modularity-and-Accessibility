# Bygg ett konsekvent UI med designprinciper

## Purpose
Practice creating a unified visual interface with a focus on hierarchy, contrast, and consistency.

## Task
1. Create an HTML page with three cards (“card components”) that display three products or
articles.
Each card should contain:
- An image (can be a location image)
- A headline
- A short description
- A button with the text “Read more”

2. Create a common CSS style for all cards.
- Use the same color theme (primary, secondary)
- Add padding, border-radius and shadow
- Create a hover effect on the button with transition

3. Ensure that the text is clearly readable (WCAG contrast).
